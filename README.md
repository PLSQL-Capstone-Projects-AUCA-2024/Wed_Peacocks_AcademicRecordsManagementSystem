## Project Overview
The **Academic Records Management System (ARMS)** aims to streamline and centralize academic data management within educational institutions. By enhancing efficiency, accessibility, and data accuracy, ARMS ensures reliable and secure handling of academic records for students, instructors, and administrators.

---

## Problem Statement

### Introduction and Problem Overview
Educational institutions generate significant student data annually. Traditional methods of managing this data, such as paper-based systems or outdated platforms, are often inefficient, prone to errors, and unable to handle the complexity of modern academic records.

The **challenges** include:
- Manual management leading to labor-intensive processes.
- High risk of errors impacting both students and staff.

### Solution
The **Academic Records Management System (ARMS)** automates and centralizes academic record management by providing:
- Seamless data retrieval and updates.
- Streamlined processes for faculty, students, and administrators.

---

## Project Objectives

1. **Centralized Data Storage**  
   A unified database consolidating student information, course details, enrollment data, grades, and instructor details.

2. **Enhanced Accessibility and User Roles**  
   Role-based access for stakeholders (students, instructors, administrators) to ensure transparency and security.

3. **Data Integrity and Accuracy**  
   Automated processes to reduce errors and maintain consistent data formats.

4. **Simplified Data Retrieval and Analysis**  
   Real-time data retrieval for academic planning, performance tracking, and decision-making.

## Project Phases Summary

### Phase 2: Business Process Modeling
Focused on creating models for managing academic records:
- **Process Mapping:** Key workflows identified (e.g., student enrollment, grading, instructor assignments).
- **Modeling Techniques:** 
  - **Swimlanes diagrams** outline tasks per role.
  - **BPMN diagrams** visualize workflows.

#### Deliverables
- `PHASE 2.docx`: Detailed business process modeling.
- `swimlanes.png`: Swimlanes diagram illustrating task allocation.
- `bpmn.png`: BPMN diagram visualizing academic record processes.

---

### Phase 3: Logical Model Design
Designed a comprehensive logical database model, defining:
- Entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints to support ARMS functionality.

#### Deliverables
- `PHASE 3.docx`: Logical data model with detailed entity descriptions.
- `FLOW_DIAGRAM.PNG`: Diagram showcasing data structure and flow.
